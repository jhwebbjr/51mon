        <b>S</b>hall I compare thee to a summer’s day?</br>
      <b>T</b>hou art more lovely and more temperate:</br>
      <b>R</b>ough winds do shake the darling buds of May,</br>
      <b>A</b>nd summer’s lease hath all too short a date;</br>
      <b>S</b>ometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,</br>
      <b>A</b>nd often is his gold complexion dimm'd;</br>
      <b>A</b>nd every fair from fair sometime declines,</br>
      <b>B</b>y chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;</br>
      <b>B</b>ut thy eternal summer shall not fade,</br>
      <b>N</b>or lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;</br>
      <b>N</b>or shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,</br>
      <b>W</b>hen in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:</br>
      <b>S</b>o long as men can breathe or eyes can see,</br>
      <b>S</b>o long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</br>
